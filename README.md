#### What can be improved? What is missing?

- Keyboard navigation.
- Show connection/error messages with toast notifications. You will find logs in the developer tools.
- Accessibility. There are no aria-labels or screen reader solutions.
- Mobile support, I have styled the app for desktop only, best viewed in 1080p+ screens.
- [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) for better readability and maintanability.
